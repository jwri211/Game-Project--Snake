# Personal Game Project - Snake
A console based classic snake game based in C#, where the player competes against a computer-controlled snake.

## Description:
I wrote this when learning C# in the first year of my Diploma in Software Development. The base snake game already existed and
the author is credited in the comments of the code. My additions brought more visual environment by adding walls and obstacles,
changing the colour of the food and adding a score. My most challenging addition was a computer controlled snake, that starts at a 
random position on the board and moves in the direction of the closest piece of food.
